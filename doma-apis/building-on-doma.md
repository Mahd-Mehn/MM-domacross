# Building on Doma

This guide outlines the steps to start building on Doma Protocol:

1. Tokenize your first domain ([this guide will help](getting-started)).
2. Create API keys using [Doma Dashboard](https://dashboard-testnet.doma.xyz/account/developers) `Developers` section.
3. Get familiar with Doma APIs (choose the best one for your use case):
   1. [Doma Subgraph](api-reference/doma-multi-chain-subgraph) - easiest way to access Doma Protocol data.
   2. [Poll API](api-reference/poll-api) - if you need to react to events or build your own database.
   3. [Doma Marketplace](doma-marketplace) - if you want to trade tokenized domains.
   4. [Smart Contracts API](api-reference/doma-smart-contracts-api) - if you need low-level no-middlemen access to a protocol.
4. Join our Discord to ask questions, provide suggestions, or report bugs.
