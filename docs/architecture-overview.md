# Architecture Overview (Draft)

## High-Level Flow

```
Trades / Listings / Offers  -->  Ingestion (market + orderbook snapshot)  -->  Domain State
                                                       |                         |
                                                       v                         v
                                                Valuation Engine <---- Historical Valuations
                                                       |
                                            Valuation Updates (websocket)
                                                       |
Competition Engine <--- Participant Portfolios <-------+------> Reward Computation (epochs/seasons)
      |                                                         |

Leaderboard Deltas (websocket)                          Merkle Snapshots / Settlement Proof

## Components

| Component                             | Responsibility                     | Notes                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| FastAPI Backend                       | REST + websocket events            | Sequenced event layer with gap backfill hooks     |
| Valuation Service                     | Multi-factor blend + ensemble stub | Fallback chain + dispute clamp                    |
| ETF Service (nav_service + fee logic) | NAV calc, accrual, distribution    | APY estimate, flows, fee events                   |
| Competition Engine                    | Epoch scoring & reward weights     | Uses risk-adjusted performance & turnover metrics |
| Anti-Abuse Guard                      | Trade pattern heuristics           | Emits `risk_flag` events                        |
| Policy/KYC Module                     | Whitelist, KYC approval workflow   | Gated reward claims                               |
| Replay Engine                         | Deterministic manifest playback    | JSONL events â†’ custom browser events             |

## Data Integrity

- Incremental event sequencing (`seq`) with `since_seq` backfill for listings/offers.
- Merkle snapshot scaffolding for settlement integrity & potential on-chain anchoring.
- Audit export with integrity hash chain (rolling digest).

## Scalability Considerations (Future)

- Move valuation & ingestion loops to worker processes (distributed queue or cron scheduler).
- Introduce caching layer for leaderboard & valuation reads (Redis keys with TTL).
- Horizontal websocket gateway (sticky sessions by user or competition id).

## Security / Hardening TODO

- JWT rotation & key vault integration.
- Websocket auth tokens & per-competition capability scoping.
- Integrity self-audit scheduled job.

## Ensemble Next Steps

- External oracle plugin interface (pull price feed adapter set).
- ML regression (features: trade density, orderbook imbalance, historical volatility, scarcity score).
- Confidence band visual overlays (frontend) using dispersion metrics.
